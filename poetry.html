          In verdant fields bathed by golden sun rays,<br />
          Strut the chickens, in a feathered ballet.<br />
          They peck and they squawk, with a glorious fuss,<br />
          Scratching for snacks in the dew-kissed grass.<br />
          <br />

          Their beaks like tiny shovels, they dig and they delve,<br />
          Uncovering treasures, a worm or a weevil.<br />
          But beneath those fluffy wings, a secret they keep,<br />
          A truth far juicier, a taste oh-so-deep.<br />
          <br />

          For chicken, my friends, though they strut and they crow,<br />
          Hold a destiny tastier than anyone knows.<br />
          Roasted to golden, with crispy, brown skin,<br />
          A succulent symphony, a culinary sin.<br />
          <br />

          So next time you see them, these feathered buffoons,<br />
          Remember the drumsticks, the wings, and the moons<br />
          Of meaty delight, waiting just out of reach,<br />
          A secret far greater than any bird-brained screech.<br />
          <br />

          So raise a drumstick, a thigh, or a wing,<br />
          To the clucking, the strutting, the tasty, the king,<br />
          Of barnyard bounty, the feathered delight,<br />
          The chicken, oh chicken, just perfect for bite!<br />
          <br />
